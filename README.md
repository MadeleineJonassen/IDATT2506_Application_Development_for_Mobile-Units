A simple todo app made for the course IDATT2506 Application_Development_for_Mobile-Units at NTNU, Trondheim.

## The Finished Product
After several user tests, I concluded that the app's first iteration seemed confusing for first-time users. Therefore I made a newer version with the option to choose categories while making the task, instead of having the task be defined by the selected category.
